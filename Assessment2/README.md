# EXPLANATION OF PAYMENT APPROACH

## Core Functionality: handlePayment

The central component of the payment processing system is the handlePayment method. This function serves as a gateway for directing payments based on user preferences.

### Dynamic Redirection

handlePayment dynamically redirects requests to the selected payment gateway where the payment flow has been introduced according to the payment gateway selected (Selected Payment Service).

### Scalability

The solution is scalable by design. The inclusion of additional payment gateways is facilitated through a switch statement within the handlePayment method. Adding a new gateway involves creating a dedicated service file and a corresponding case, providing a systematic and modular approach.

## Modular Design

Each payment gateway is encapsulated within its own service file. This modular structure enhances code organization, simplifies maintenance, and isolates changes to specific gateways without affecting the overall system.

## Business Logic Independence

The separation of payment processing logic from the core business logic ensures that modifications or additions to payment gateways do not impact the integrity of the project's foundational components.
