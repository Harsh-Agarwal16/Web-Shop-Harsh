# EXPLANATION OF PAYMENT APPROACH

### 1. /src/app
This directory contains the core files and modules of the Angular application:
app.component.*: The root component serving as the entry point for the application.
app.module.ts: The main Angular module orchestrating the application, declaring components, services, and other modules.

### 2. /src/core
The core directory houses essential functionalities for the application:
/interceptors: Angular interceptors for handling HTTP requests and responses.
/guards: Route guards controlling access to specific routes based on user authentication or authorization.
/services: Core services providing fundamental functionality for the application.

### 3. /src/core/services/payment.service.ts
Purpose: The PaymentService is a central service managing the registration and selection of payment providers. It includes methods to register new providers and initiate the payment process based on the chosen provider.

### 4. /src/core/providers
The providers directory contains implementations for different payment providers:
payment-provider.interface.ts: Defines the common interface, PaymentProvider, implemented by all payment providers.
/stripe, /braintree, /paypal, /new-provider: Each sub-directory includes a provider implementation for a specific payment service.

### 5. /src/modules
The modules directory contains feature-specific modules for different entities of the web shop:
/product, /category, /customer, /order, /shipping, /payment: Each module has its own components, services, and models related to the corresponding entity.

### 6. /src/shared
The shared directory holds components, models, and other resources that are reusable across the application:
/components: Reusable Angular components used across different modules.
/models: Shared data models used consistently throughout the application.

### 7. /src/modules/payment
The payment module directory contains components, services, and models specifically related to the payment functionality:
/components/payment-selection.component.ts: A component allowing users to select their preferred payment provider.

### 8. /src/routes
The routes directory manages the Angular routing configuration:
app-routing.module.ts: Defines how URLs map to specific components and manages navigation paths within the application.

### 9. /src/assets and /src/styles
/assets: Stores static assets such as images.
/styles: Contains global styles (e.g., CSS, SCSS) applied throughout the application.

### 10. /src/core/providers/payment-provider.interface.ts
**Purpose:** Defines the common interface, PaymentProvider, implemented by all payment providers.
**Method:**
`processPayment(amount: number): Promise<string>: Represents the method for processing payments.`

### 11. /src/core/providers/stripe/stripe.provider.ts
**Purpose:** Implementation of the PaymentProvider interface for the Stripe payment service.
**Method:**
`processPayment(amount: number): Promise<string>: Simulated Stripe payment processing logic.`

### 12. /src/core/providers/braintree/braintree.provider.ts
**Purpose:** Implementation of the PaymentProvider interface for the Braintree payment service.
**Method:**
`processPayment(amount: number): Promise<string>: Simulated Braintree payment processing logic.`

### 13. /src/core/providers/paypal/paypal.provider.ts
**Purpose:** Implementation of the PaymentProvider interface for the PayPal payment service.
**Method:**
`processPayment(amount: number): Promise<string>: Simulated PayPal payment processing logic.`

### 14. /src/core/providers/new-provider/new-provider.ts
**Purpose:** Placeholder for a potential new payment provider.
**Method:**
`processPayment(amount: number): Promise<string>: Placeholder for the new provider's payment processing logic.`
